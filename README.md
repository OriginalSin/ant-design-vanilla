[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftaejs%2Fant-design-vanilla.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftaejs%2Fant-design-vanilla?ref=badge_shield)

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript Implementation, originating from [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design).

Welcome to create an issue if there's a problem or suggestion

## Goal
### 1. Independant
It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks.

### 2. Integration
It's adaptable to rendering third-party referring to [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) structures.

## Installiation [WIP]

Unfortunately for now, all packages is WIP so there's no way to import Ant Design Vanilla. 
Working on deploying NPM and CDN for each package using Lerna.

It's only testable through `test.html` located at `packages/ant-design-vanilla/__test__`
